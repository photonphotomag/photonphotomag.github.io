<b>The Human Experience: A Mythic Analysis</b>
<p>
We experience our world through our hands. They are something human and personal, yet common between us. Simply by looking at a person’s hands, we gain insight into their world. My project, a photography series which I have titled The Human Experience takes us through the eight stages of the Voyage of the Hero, from birth through death to apotheosis. My photographs do not serve as a narration of a single voyage; rather, they are a collection of representations of the stages. They do not seek to embody all the motifs of the stages. Rather, I venture to explore the simple nature of certain motifs, archetypes and symbols using the hand in moments of time. My photographs of human hands are simple and intimate, and by choosing to depict the hero’s journey using hands, I remind us of this simple truth: epic voyages and chivalrous deeds aside, the Voyage of the Hero is a representation of the universally common, yet personal human experience that is what makes us who we are.
<p>
The voyage begins in my first photograph, where young fingers test the waters. This is birth. By taking this picture through a bowl filled with water, I was able to create a subtle blur and distortion to make the image have a soft dreamlike quality. We are reminded of the basic sense of touch, so important to the human experience, and in this photograph touch is portrayed as pure and beautiful; the soft aura surrounding the fingers is provocative of divinity and the sense of perfection and miracle. In our most basic element, in the early hours of morning and in our first breaths of life, what we experience goes no further than the sense of touch; all is unknown, all is unimportant and vague but the innocent and vulnerable, yet vital, sense of feeling.
<p>
My second photograph is an abstraction of childhood. The fact that the fingertips play with bubbles and yet reach out even further, almost to the edge of the frame, suggests an expansion of consciousness. A Celtic triskele, a symbol of growth, and therefore learning, begins to take form on the palm of the hand; it is the mark gained in childhood. Bits and pieces of the painted symbol float in the water, marring its clarity and purity. Yet innocence remains, evident in the tender, subtle touch of the fingertips against the bubbles. Simultaneously, the mark of growth is reminiscent of the Sage; a desire for truth is beginning to emerge amidst the directionless wonder of innocence. This directionless exploration of self and the world is experienced by every living thing, especially humans; it’s when we yawn, when we breathe, and when we stretch. It’s another way in which the Voyage of the Hero is, at its core, simplistic and universal.
<p>
In my next photograph, which depicts a fist, I explore the changed sense of self we all experience in the next stage of our journey. Still young, yet now with a sharper and more prominent mark of growth etched into the skin, this hand represents the Preparation stage. The clenched fist suggests hard work and determination. Everything is more clear, strong, and harshly defined. We can’t help but compare this sudden change in clarity and light to the previous stages. I purposefully took this picture in the dark, to signify the isolated birth cave in which a hero trains. No longer are we dwelling in the haze of innocence. I also utilized the Warrior archetype here; from the usage of a clenched fist, we can gather that this hand values strength over weakness and confrontation over flight.
Now comes the quest, which I represented with a photograph of a hand reaching skyward. A path - upward - is finally defined. We cannot see the what the hand reaches for, but it is obvious that there is a goal in mind, and that a growing awareness of the world has enabled this hand to reach outward for something. Now grimy and weathered, it is clear that the hands have met multiple challenges. Growth, symbolized by the same Celtic symbol, continues to motivate motion.
<p>
The photograph of two crossed arms suggests death. We get the sense that the character is falling, and the cross shape has the religious connotation of Jesus, and therefore death. Additionally, we can see this hand confronts a shadow; light is scarce, and the shadow embodies the form of the hand, suggestive of struggle. This image leads us seamlessly into the underworld; there is a sense of a deep, desperate fall, perhaps into an abyss, the only light from the hole above.
<p>
I chose to represent the underworld with a dead stick grasped by a fist. This is an allusion to the motif that the world has died around the hero. Shadow now dominates the frame entirely, representing a great struggle with one’s own monster, and the fact shadow covers all but a little skin is evocative of the sense that the old self is disappearing. Isolation is prominent. The way this fist holds the stick is similar to the way it would hold a torch; I am trying to create the suggestion that the character is lost.
<p>
I struggled to depict Resurrection. I chose to represent it as a coming-to-terms feeling instead of as glorious. The hands are placed in a clasped yin-yang position, symbolic of a return in balance. The dark nature of the photograph does not seek to evoke desperation, but serenity and a greater understanding; almost meditative. The idea of connection is prominent.
<p>
The final stage of the Voyage of the Hero, Apotheosis, is represented by two open hands. For the first time, we see hands ready to receive; this gives the sense that they are preparing the way for another. The source of light is not visible, but the knowledge that it is there is reassuring and reminiscent of the motif of rising to divinity. I used a soft light for this photograph to connect it back to the blurred focus of the birth stage, suggesting that the cycle is complete. The Caregiver can be found in this final image, where the open position of the hands seems protective, caring, and welcoming of others. In this final photograph, I again do not address the glory of the apotheosis; I instead explore the subtlety of it.
<p>
The fact that the Voyage of the Hero can be represented through simplistic hand movements suggests that the journey is built into the very nature of human life; it is an experience felt universally on the most basic level. By photographing the expressiveness of human hands, I explore the core of the heroic journey, which resides in the human experience.
