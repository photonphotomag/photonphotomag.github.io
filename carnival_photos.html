                <h2>Carnival</h2>
                <i>From Issue Three, September 2017</i> 
                
                <p>In mid-September, I stood outside a carnival on a peninsula in Rhode Island. From where I was, the spinning lights of various rides all blended together to form a singular lighted spectacle. The lights and the fog hung suspended together on the beach, rising and falling and glittering with one another. I felt like I could reach out and grab it, and it would roll into my hand like a snowglobe.
                <p> It was called “Fall Fest,” and these words shone out in red lights from an electronic billboard. As you entered the carnival, you were instantly surrounded by people and their conversations. Brightly lit rides spun and swung in the air, and a band played in the middle of it all.
                <p> These photographs are some of my favorites from the carnival. 
                    <p>
